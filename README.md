Basic Solar System Simulation with Scene Graph + Illumination

This project was prepared for CS 405 course. The aim of the project is to create a mini Solar System simulation. Scane Graph is used within the scope of the project and lighting techniques are also used in the completion of the following tasks.

Task 1

While completing this task, the SceneNode.js file was edited. The necessary transformation matrices were added to the draw function in the file. MVP, ModelView, Normals and Model matrix transformations were made for each node. In addition, child nodes were also called..

Task 2

While completing this task, the MeshDrawer.js file was edited. Changes were made in the Fragment shader to improve the light on the objects. The Diffuse component was calculated by calculating the dot product between the light direction and the normal vector. In addition, the Specular component was defined by calculating the angle between the viewer direction and the reflected light. As a result of this section, the visuals looked more realistic in the scene.

Task 3

To complete Task 3, the planet Mars was added to the scene. Mars was defined as a different node to be added. The html file was edited to complete this flood.

When you double-click on the html file you can see the simulation.

Enjoy !!
